### 👋 Hi there! I'm a Full-Stack Problem Solver Who Designs for Real-World Impact

With over 15 years of experience in backend development, I specialize in building scalable, maintainable software using Spring, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and other enterprise technologies. I'm passionate about designing MSA-based platforms that solve real customer problems.

🧠 I lead agile sprints, manage AS support workflows, and design intelligent automation for message routing, API lifecycle management, and chatbot-assisted customer service.  

💡 I'm currently exploring something to enhance geolocation-based services — like real-time shadow tracking. 🤓

📚 I enjoy contributing to developer knowledge via documentation, automation tips, and blogging — and I’m looking to contribute to open-source projects with low entry barriers.
